# Tetris

This is a initiative of creating a Tetris but without libraries, just using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Nowadays, so used to roll out things helped with very useful libraries made me want to go back to the roots to face a challenge. On a game like tetris things like the render of the board, the movement of the figures, their rotations, the logic to erase lines and to create random new figures I think that make a good challenging project.
